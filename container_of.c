/*

 * Now we will assume that we have three containers. Container-1 has gold, 
 * Container-2 has diamond and Container-3 has filled with Water (Probably 
 * water is the most precious than gold and diamond). 
 * One guy come and ask you that which 
 * container contains Water (Container of water). I need it desperately. 
 * You would say, Container-3 has water.
 *
 * So in this example, that guy knows that one container contains water, 
 * but donâ€™t know which container it is. 
 * He was using the member name (water) to know the container name or 
 * container address. So this is the use of Container_of macro in Linux kernel.
